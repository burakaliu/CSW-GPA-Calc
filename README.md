## Phasing
If you aren't sure about what phases your classes are, you're dumb. Go to Schoology and see what number is before your class name. Ex. "6-AP CALCULUS AB: Section 4-D" would be phase 6, which means its an AP class. If you still don't know what phase your class is, use this general guideline:
- All Honors classes count as phase 5
- All phase 6 and dual enrollment classes are the same as AP classes
- All normal science classes count as phase 4
- Any normal class without a phase is usually phase 4
- If you're still confused, just ask your teacher tomorrow

## Issues and Support
If you find any issues or problems, just find me in school or email me:
unlu.burak@charterschool.org

If you want to support me so I can continue making projects like these, gimme snacks during lunch. Or money. That works too.
